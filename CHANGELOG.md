## Migration Guides

### From Other Chatwoot Nodes

If you're migrating from another Chatwoot node (e.g., sufficit/n8n-nodes-chatwoot):

1. **Credentials:** Create new credentials - structure may differ
2. **Resource Names:** Check if resource names changed
3. **Operations:** Verify operation names (e.g., "getAll" vs "get many")
4. **Fields:** Some field names may differ (check documentation)
5. **Test:** Always test in a non-production workflow first
